# Aragon App Installation Guides

1Hive is creating an [app installer](https://installer.1hive.org/) that allows you to install apps via a website similar to the [Aragon DAO creation page](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/create). This is great, and whenever possible we recommend using this method. That being said, it picks default installation paths and not all Aragon apps are available. For everything else, you'll have to use the Aragon CLI.

- **TL;DR:** for most things use the web apps for DAO creation and app installation, but for everything else use the CLI.
